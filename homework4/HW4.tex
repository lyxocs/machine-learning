		Show that maximization of the class separation criterion given by $m_2 - m_1 = w^T(m_2- m_1) $ with respect ot $w$, using a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the constraint $w^Tw = 1$, leads to the result that $w \propto (m_2 - m_1)$.

		Show that the Fisher criterion
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{aligned}
				j(w) = \frac{(m_2 - m_1)^2}{s_1^2 + s_2^2}
			\end{aligned}
		\end{equation*}
		can be written in the form
		\begin{equation*}
			j(w) = \frac{w^wS_Bw}{w^TS_Ww}

		Consider a agenerative classification model for K classes defined by prior class probabilities $p(C_k)=\pi_k$ and general class-conditional dendities $p(\phi | C_k)$ where $\phi$ is the input feature vector. Suppose we are given a training data set$\{\phi_n,t_n\}$ where $n=1,...,N,$ and $t_n$ is a binary target vector of length K that uses the 1-of-K coding scheme, so that it has components $t_{nj} = I_{jk}$ if pattern n is from class $C_k$. Assuming that data points are drown independently from this model, show that the maximum-likelihood solution for the prior probabilities is given by
		\begin{equation*}
			\pi_k = \frac{N_k}{N}
		\end{equation*}
		where $N_k$ is the number of data points assigned to class $C_k$.
		\item 
		Verify the relation
		\begin{equation*}
			\frac{d\sigma}{da}=\sigma(1-\sigma)
		\end{equation*}
		for the derivative of the logistic sigmoid function defined by
		\begin{equation*}
			\sigma(a) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-a)}
		\end{equation*}

		There are several possible ways in which to generalize the concept of linear discriminant functions from two classes to c classes. One possibility would be to use $(c-1)$ linear discrimminant functions, such that $y_k(x)>0$ for inputs x in class $C_k$ and $y_k(x) < 0$ for not in class $C_k$. By drawing a simple example in two dimensions for $c=3$, show that this approach can lead to regions of x-space for which the classification is ambiguous. Another approach would be to use one discriminant functino $y_{jk}(x)$ for each possible pair of classes $C_j$ and $C_k$, such that $y_{jk}(x) >0$ for patterns in class $C_j$ and $y_{jk}(x) <0$ for patterns in class $C_k$. For c classes, we would need $c(c-1)/2$ discriminant functions. Again, by drawing a specific example in two dimensions for $c=3$, show that this approach can also lead to ambiguous regions.

		Given a set of data points $\{x^n\}$ we can define the convex hull to be the set of points x given by
		\begin{equation*}
			x = \sum_n \alpha_n x^n
		\end{equation*}
		where $\alpha_n >=0$ and $\sum_n \alpha_n = 1$. Consider a second set of point $\{z^m\}$and its corresponding convex hull. The two sets of points will be linearly separable if there exists a vector $\hat{w}$ and a scalar $\omega_0$ such that $\hat{w}^Tx^n+\omega_0 >0$ for all $x^n$, and $\hat{w}^Tz^m + \omega_0<0$ for all $z^m$. Show that, if their convex hulls intersect, the two sets of points cannot be linearly separable, and conversely that, if they are linearly separable, their convex hulls do not intersect.
